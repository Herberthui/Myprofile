										<h2>Automotive real-time projection system</h2>
										<p>Automotive real-time projection system which means using the projection in the windscreen to respond to the most real-time traffic conditions to the driver’s reference. This system can reflect the real-time road conditions and give the driver the most convenient route to the destination to avoid traffic jams. In addition, the system can analysis of accident risk rate by road condition and vehicle speed, once the accident occurs, the car will give a certain braking system to avoid accidents or mitigate accident damage. Giving the driver the safest driving environment.
</p>
                                                                                 <P>Many traffic accidents occur every year in Australia, in 2017, there has 1225 numbers of people death because traffic accident. The top four causes of fatal car accidents in Australia were speeding, alcohol consumption, driver fatigue and inattention/distraction while driving. All four factors are easily prevented and within human control. There are 13million cars in Australia, and so there is a huge market for an Automotive real-time projection system. Customizing a car real-time projection system using a Linux system can create a very secure system. The production cost of this system is much lower than the loss caused by the accident.

"This system is based on the Linux depth development of the car‘s central control system, which integrates the car’s central screen and instrument panel together in a system that feeds back onto the windshield of the car through projection technology. The biggest advantage of this system is that the driver does not have to change the vision to observe various driving information, for example , in the navigation mode, the route will be projected onto the front windshield in the form of augmented reality，and an arrow will be displayed to indicate the driver before turning . The system can also display all the information such as the tire pressure of the car, the fuel condition of the engine, the speed of the car, etc. In addition, there is no need to use the manual input command during driving, and the driver can speak the command by voice control to make the system respond.



The cause of the accident is mostly due to speeding, the system analyzes the speed of the vehicle and the speed of other cars on the road through the radar system installed in the vehicle to alert the driver to safety and reduce the speed. When the system detects that an accident is about to happen, the central control system will interfere with the driving system to reduce the speed of the vehicle or reduce the accident rate by emergency braking and reduce the accident damage rate. Australia is driven by a right-hand rudder, some people in the left rudder country are very uncomfortable when they come to Australia, they are easy to retrograde while driving the vehicle. The car is very prone to serious traffic when it deviates from the road and retrograde during driving accident. During the daily driving process, once the system detects that the car is off the road or retrograde, it will give a warning prompt to return the owner to the correct lane. The system also records the driving habits of the driver and makes corresponding adjustments, if the driver needs to go beyond the car in front, the system will analyze the road conditions and provide feedback to the owner for reference on the projections under safe conditions.
Not only that, but if there are other cars coming out of the intersection when the car is about to cross the intersection, the system will provide warning information and display it on the windshield. This method helps many drivers receive information on many driving blind spots. 
Automotive real-time projection system can analyze the influence of car’s illumination, and adjust the tone of the augmented reality display to adjust the clarity of the information seen by the driver when the driver clearly sees the road condition, without any impact on the driver’s realization."

										<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>

                                                                                <P>Software: The system is based on Linux development because Linux is a more secure operating system. Through integration tools “Gitlab-ci” building an integration framework. CarSim, Simulink simulation software.
 The software required for UI design has Photoshop, Illustrator, Sublime, After Effect, etc. Mycroft AI can be used in voice operation.
</P>
<P>Hardware：GPS antenna, Camera , Multi-layer laser scanner, Brake actuator,3D laser scanner, IMU, Vehicle controller，Augmented reality projector.</P>
          
                                                                                 <h3>Skills Required</h3>
								
                                                                                <P>Designers must have experience designing automotive control systems and autonomous driving. 
High level of using C/C++, Matlab , Gitlab-ci, CarSim, Simulink. proficiency in UI design software. Solid theoretical foundation of automatic control and rich experience in practical projects. Familiar with vehicle chassis control, body dynamics, tire characteristics. Referring to the example of Tesla's development, it may not be too difficult to find the above skills. The most difficult part is to talk about the coordination of all the hardware and systems of the car. Solving the security of the system requires a lot of testing to draw conclusions</P>
                                                                                <P>2. Applicant must have very strong level of HTML5, CSS, SCSS, and JavaScript and jQuery, also have experience to use Angular, React or VueJS some kind of web framework software. The anther skills required is applicant must have strong knowledge of responsive designs and well use Adobe software. In addition, applicant should have strong knowledge of .NET/C#PHP and SEO. Therefore, applicant need to have perfect problem solving skill, analytical skill and interpersonal skills.

<h4>Outcome</h4>

                                                                                                                                                             <P>If the project is successful, it will change the navigation industry. People no longer rely on previous cell phones and car navigation systems, which is more convenient for drivers. The driver is not taking the wrong road while watching the navigation, and reducing the penalty for violation of traffic. The most important thing is to greatly reduce the incidence of traffic accidents and reduce economic losses.
